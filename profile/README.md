## üïâÔ∏è Ved Vyas Foundation

Do you ever feel like Sanatana Dharma websites and apps are stuck in the past? Like they're not keeping up with the times and don't appeal to younger generations?

At the Ved Vyas Foundation, we are on a mission to change that!

We are devoted to making the transcendental wisdom from the Indian scriptures accessible to anyone, anywhere, anytime. We do this by creating state-of-the-art web and mobile applications, educational content on social media as well as working with like-minded individuals and organisations.

We believe that by making the ancient teachings of Sanatana Dharma relevant to modern life, we can inspire a new generation of Dharma followers and create a more compassionate and harmonious world.
